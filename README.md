Coding assessment

# Checkin-1
Analysis of the assignment.
Choice of package for pdf filling is made.(Trade off and reasoning mentioned in Thought process)
Facebook Boilerplate for React (frontend) and file structure.

# Checkin-2
A Node.js service using Express.js is created that can accept an address is created.(TODO: Error scenarios handling)

#Thought process
Part-1:
- Out of all the pdffiller packages mentioned, pdf-fill-form is the best since it supports checkbox and radio buttons too over pdffiller. 
  A tradeoff is made due to windows development and choose pdffiller, which suffices the requirement.

#Instructions to run the solution.The list do not contain trivial installations like node, React boiler plate(create-react-app).
- This solution requires windows system.
- Install pdftk before installing pdffiller package.
